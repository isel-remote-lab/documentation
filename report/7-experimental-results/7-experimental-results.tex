To validate the proper behavior of the system, comprehensive unit tests were implemented for the web \acs{api}. Each module undergoes thorough testing, covering both success and error states to ensure robustness and reliability.

In future work, we aim to expand the test coverage significantly and implement load testing to evaluate system performance under various conditions. These load tests will provide valuable insights into response times during peak usage periods, enabling us to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance accordingly. The results from these comprehensive tests will guide further improvements to enhance the overall system efficiency and user experience.
